Sun: Music & Sound Strand (Arts with Community)
Overview
This strand introduces sound and music practices as tools for community engagement, dialogue, and collective creativity. Students will explore improvisation, composition, rhythm, and technology not only as musical practices but also as ways of working inclusively with others. Activities include building instruments, experimenting with scores, exploring digital media, and reflecting critically on culture and politics. Emphasis is placed on collaboration, low-barrier entry points, and transforming each session’s learning into tangible projects and artefacts.

2. Apply improvisation, composition, and technological tools in community arts contexts.
3. Critically engage with cultural, political, and ethical issues in sound practice.
4. Create and adapt instruments, scores, and digital artefacts to support participatory contexts.
5. Reflect critically on practice through digital journals, linking sound-making to wider social and cultural themes.

Planet: Improvisation
Overview
Improvisation has always been the core of my practice. It is not a single genre or style but a messy, contradictory, living set of practices. The word free itself is complicated: capital-F Free Jazz versus lived freedom. This is what I call the burden of freedom: you can only really improvise freely if you know yourself, your culture, your history. Improvisation is not about doing whatever you want, but about how freedom is made, contested, and shared in real time.
Moons
- What is Freedom? (Freedom Box)
  Students write what freedom means to them on slips of paper and place them in a Freedom Box. Open at the end of the year to reflect on shifts in understanding.
  Purpose: sustained reflection on freedom as lived practice.
- Sustain Piece (after Oliveros)
  Sing a sustained note for the length of a breath. Inhale, then attempt to re-create the same note. Variations: sitting, standing, mirroring others, walking.
  Purpose: embodied listening and ensemble attunement.
- Click & Sustain (John Stevens)
  The group sustains long tones until someone makes a short note, which cues everyone to switch to shorts.
  Purpose: explore collective change and cueing.
- Pass a Sound
  One player makes a short sound or phrase; the next repeats it as closely as possible. Continue in a circle.
  Purpose: precise listening and mimicry.
- Free Play
  Open improvisation as an activity in itself, with rotating prompts (texture, density, register).
  Purpose: trust, risk, shared authorship.
- Walking Piece
  Each student walks in a straight line across the room, making sounds with whatever they encounter. The piece ends when they reach the other side.
  Purpose: spatial awareness, form, ensemble presence.
- Conduction (after Butch Morris)
  Introduce a vocabulary of hand cues (start/stop, sustain, solo/duo, freeze). Rotate conductors.
  Purpose: structured improvisation; leadership as listening.
- Onkyo / Silence Exercise
  A 20-minute piece where each participant may only make three sounds total.
  Purpose: restraint, space, attention to sonic detail.
- Identity Cards Score
  Students write three words about their identity or expression on index cards. Cards are pooled and drawn to generate text scores.
  Purpose: connect self-expression with collective composition.

Planet: Composition & Collaboration (Scores)
Overview
A score is never only fixed notes. It is a scaffold, recipe, or provocation. Not all composition is improvisation, but all improvisation is composition. We treat scores as invitations into relationship: text, images, sounds, diagrams, recipes. What matters is not authority of the page but the practice it sparks: negotiation, interpretation, futures.
Moons
- Composers & Scores (Introduction)
  Survey of score types: staff notation, graphic, text, time, video, movement.
  Purpose: recognise the breadth of what a score can be.
- Percussion – Build & Rhythm
  Build percussion instruments from found materials. Explore hocketing, phasing, and hohup (breath–rhythm cycle). Create short rhythmic scores (text, symbols, or grids).
  Purpose: collective rhythm as trust and interdependence.
- Collaboration Practices
  Create ensemble scores from fragments (words, drawings, gestures). Identity Cards from Improvisation may be used as raw material.
  Purpose: co-authorship, negotiation, editing.
- GIO Score Anthology Project
  Students curate and contribute to a living anthology of graphic and text scores with Glasgow Improvisers Orchestra.
  Purpose: archival practice and shared repertoire.

Planet: Resonant Matter
Overview
Resonant Matter is where we work with sound as vibration, material, and circuitry. From microphones and PA systems to soldering contact mics and activating resonant objects, this planet focuses on the tangible labour of sound. In a community arts context, these practices are vital: learning how to set up a PA, wrap a cable, or solder a pickup is not just technical skill — it’s knowledge that makes collective soundmaking possible. Resonant Matter also stretches into building custom sensors, using gesture devices, and exploring feedback as a shared sonic environment. Here, making is a way of listening, and technology is understood as a social practice.
Moons
- Recording & Studio Basics
  Learn foundational studio and live-sound practices:
  - Choosing microphones for different sources (dynamic vs condenser, close vs ambient)
  - Using soundcards / audio interfaces
  - Correct mic placement (vocals, percussion, strings, etc.)
  - PA setup and gain structure
  - Safe cabling and cable wrapping
  - Basic troubleshooting (signal flow, phantom power, feedback avoidance)
  Purpose: demystify recording and amplification; empower students to adapt tools for community practice.
- Resonating Objects & Pickups
  Learn to design, solder, and build contact microphones and telephone pickup coils. Test them with different resonant surfaces (metal, wood, glass, ceramic) and explore methods of activation (bowing, tapping, rubbing, electromagnetic fields).
  Purpose: understand how resonance works in everyday materials; make low-cost tools for amplifying hidden sounds.
- Interactive & Gesture Instruments
  Experiment with gloves, rings, mats, and custom apps to transform movement into sound. Explore mapping, accessibility, and co-creation using embodied interfaces.
  Purpose: expand performance beyond traditional instruments; create accessible, playful tools for collective improvisation.
- Feedback Systems
  Using amps, mics, and speakers, set up and shape controlled feedback. Work with placement, routing, and space to explore how feedback becomes an ensemble practice.
  Purpose: reframe feedback not as error but as shared sonic potential; highlight space and body as part of the instrument.

Planet: Networked Worlds
Overview
Networked Worlds is where sound becomes a way of connecting across distance, species, and realities. Here we listen with more-than-human worlds, work with remote technologies, and experiment with intelligent and immersive systems. In community practice, these tools let us hear each other differently: a river can answer a question, a Zoom call can become a choir, an AI can improvise alongside us, and VR can open shared speculative spaces. I frame this through my ongoing work on transpecies listening: asking how humans, machines, and ecologies co-compose, and how community practices can attune us to the voices of those often unheard.
Moons
- Field Recording & Posthuman Interviews
  - Learn field techniques (binaural, shotgun, contact mics).
  - Conduct “interviews” with rivers, trees, objects, and environments.
  - Explore eco-acoustics and posthuman perspectives.
  Purpose: expand listening beyond the human; treat environments as co-participants.
- Network Music (Zoom & Beyond)
  - Use Zoom as a performance platform for remote improvisation.
  - Explore latency as creative material.
  - Compare alternative tools (e.g. JackTrip, Sonobus, browser-based platforms).
  Purpose: practice distributed collaboration, discover how networks reshape time and listening.
- AI & Community (Chimère Project)
  - Work with Chimère and Chimère Communities as a model of community-led AI art practice.
  - Explore dataset ethics, representation, and technomoral perspectives (Shannon Vallor).
  - Experiment with multi-modal AI creativity (sound, text, visuals).
  - Compare Chimère’s philosophy to commercial AI tools.
  Purpose: build an ethical and community-based approach to AI in the arts.
- VR & Immersion
  - Explore immersive audio and VR environments.
  - Share learning from Immersive Arts UK projects (e.g. Syzygy with Colin).
  - Design speculative soundwalks, binaural experiences, and accessibility-centred VR practices.
  Purpose: imagine inclusive, collective futures through immersive sound.

Planet: Cultures & Politics
Overview
Cultures & Politics is where sound and music are understood as situated, relational, and entangled with histories of identity, tradition, and struggle. Improvisation and composition are never neutral: they carry the weight of history, culture, and power. For community arts practice, this means working across difference: listening to marginalised voices, learning from diverse traditions, engaging with archives, and creating spaces for dialogue. This planet is also about storytelling and the anarchive: making, unmaking, and remaking cultural memory through sound and verbatim text.
Moons
- Politics of Freedom
  Explore Afrological and Eurological perspectives on improvisation (George E. Lewis, AACM, European free improvisation, South African exile musicians).
  Purpose: develop critical awareness of how “freedom” in music is always historically and politically situated.
- Working Across Cultures
  Collaborative sessions that foreground cultural difference and exchange.
  Purpose: practice intercultural dialogue and inclusive ensemble work.
- Archive Practice & Anarchive
  Work with archives not as fixed collections but as living, unsettled, and re-activatable materials. Engage with GIO’s developing score anthology and artistic practices that treat archives as sites of speculation and community-making.
  Purpose: explore how sound archives, verbatim text, and environmental recordings can become performative and transformative.
- Storytelling & Verbatim Sound
  Gather spoken stories from peers, local community members, or collaborators. Work with verbatim text (phrases, breaths, pauses). Explore how sound can support, interrupt, or transform storytelling; introduce SF (speculative fabulation/fiction) to imagine futures and invite nonhuman voices.
  Purpose: story as political and communal act; memory work and future-making.
- Extended Techniques (Traditional Instruments)
  Explore extended techniques on students’ own instruments.
  Purpose: connect cultural traditions with experimental practices; question “legitimate” sound.

Planet: Practice-Based Research
Overview
Practice-Based Research is the planet where we treat making as thinking. Instead of separating theory and practice, we use creative activity as a mode of research, generating knowledge through sound, performance, writing, and community process. My own work has developed through auto-sociology and autoethnographic practice — methods that place the self in relation to larger cultural, ecological, and political structures. In community contexts, this means acknowledging how personal narratives, social identities, and lived experiences are part of the research material, not separate from it. We’ll explore non-linear, multimodal, and anarchival ways of writing and documenting research, including scores as arguments, videos as essays, and stories as data. This is about making research porous, allowing communities to co-author knowledge, and seeing artistic practice itself as a form of world-building.
Moons
- Auto-sociology & Autoethnography
  Explore creative self-documentation: writing, journaling, and reflective practice as research.
  Purpose: understand your own position as an artist within social, cultural, and political contexts.
- Experimental Writing & Video Articles
  Create short non-linear or multimedia essays in the style of the *Journal of Artistic Research* or Ben Spatz’s *Journal of Embodied Research*.
  Purpose: rethink how research can be communicated — beyond text, into sound, image, and movement.
- Story, Sound & Anarchive
  Work with verbatim texts, oral histories, and community narratives. Pair them with sound, improvisation, or performance.
  Purpose: consider how archives can be unsettled, re-activated, and transformed into living, communal “anarchives.”
- Literature Sourcing & Reading Practices
  Explore methods for finding, digesting, and embedding research texts into creative practice.
  Purpose: develop critical reading as a creative skill; build a personal and collective toolkit of references.
